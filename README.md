- What if France was the country who invented coding? How would this change coding languages today?
- This is a basic esolang with functionality that includes a few inbuilt functions, operators, and support for variables

# Challenges
- I had to restart my approach to compiling code multiple times due to my lack of understanding of how programming languages parse through code. This not only took a lot of time, but was also pretty demoralizing, which is why I'll probably leave this project in its minimal state as it is.
- However, this isn't without any lessons. The main thing I learned is that although it can be helpful to focus on one step at a time, research **must** be done to create a plan and determine what those steps are because taking more time to get something correct will almost always be better than taking less time for each attempt but have many tries.

# Example of Capabilities
- Just some code I made C:

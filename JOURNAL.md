- Title: "Python en Francais"
- Description:

What if France was the country who invented coding? How would this change coding languages today?

Embark on a journey of linguistic challenges to become French (trust) by using this totally certified coding language that includes (mostly?) everything you need! (includes loops, conditionals, and user input for only an extra $0.00!)

- Started by brainstorming ideas
- Then, I started with doing quite a bit of research on how I would be able to bring my idea to a website, especially since downloading code and running it yourself is pretty annoying,
so including a way to run custom code online would drastically improve QoL

- I eventually settled on using Flask and React, and through the documentation, I was able to successfully install these two frameworks and get the website working
- In order to use API with the backend, I created a page at the address "/api/test", which when went to returned:

- Initally when trying to then push this code onto Github, I ran into an issue
- After restructuring the repo to have a frontend and backend folder, the node_modules folder was no longer correctly referenced in .gitignore, causing there to be a problem with file sizes being too big
- Since I didn't know much about react, I didn't originally know that node_modules was supposed to be in .gitignore, but after asking, I determined that it would be the best possible thing I could try (and it worked)

- Just started making everything look 100x better, which took a LOT of time looking at documentation to figure out how to get a certain look, especially with how long its been since I've done web development
- Ended up adding a header navbar and started adding boxes to input code and for the output, however, I will be focusing on the functionality next rather than looks

- Realized I don't even need to use flask (and could instead just use JS), but this will be restructured during the next session!

- Added javascript code that runs after hitting the button with a good basis for expansion later on

- found out that a for loop thats really long could cause the page to freeze, so I'll be trying to fix that next session.

# 7/11/2025

* update styling a bit
* researched and found out about a way to make the code truly run async

* added print function and operations with strings, and +,-,*,/

- The most difficult part for sure was getting the order I should check for each operation to ensure that arithmetic errors don't happen

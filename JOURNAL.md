- Title: "Python en Francais"
- Description:

What if France was the country who invented coding? How would this change coding languages today?

Embark on a journey of linguistic challenges to become French (trust) by using this totally certified coding language that includes (mostly?) everything you need! (includes loops, conditionals, and user input for only an extra $0.00!)

- Started by brainstorming ideas
- Then, I started with doing quite a bit of research on how I would be able to bring my idea to a website, especially since downloading code and running it yourself is pretty annoying,
so including a way to run custom code online would drastically improve QoL

- I eventually settled on using Flask and React, and through the documentation, I was able to successfully install these two frameworks and get the website working
- In order to use API with the backend, I created a page at the address "/api/test", which when went to returned:

- Initally when trying to then push this code onto Github, I ran into an issue
- After restructuring the repo to have a frontend and backend folder, the node_modules folder was no longer correctly referenced in .gitignore, causing there to be a problem with file sizes being too big
- Since I didn't know much about react, I didn't originally know that node_modules was supposed to be in .gitignore, but after asking, I determined that it would be the best possible thing I could try (and it worked)
